## Numerical integration
* Compute integral from any given function y(x) by using small summation over region of graph in the given range

### Method
* Define f(x), x0, x1
* Integrate from x_0 to x_1 which dx = (x_1 - x_0) / N
* $S = sum_{x_i=1}^{n} f_i(x_i)*dx$

## Mandelbrot
* Compute Mandelbrot set by dividing into sub-grid to 
compute and send back to combine the image to see

### Method
*
